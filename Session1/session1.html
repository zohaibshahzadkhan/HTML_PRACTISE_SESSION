            HTML pages are text documents.HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
            (brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.Tags are often referred to as elements.
            Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotesthe start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
            the end.Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us moreabout the content of that element.
            Attributes require a name and a value.
            To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where theycan go.
