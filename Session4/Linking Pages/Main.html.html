        <p>
           Methodology is the systematic, theoretical analysis of the methods applied to a field of study. <br />
           It comprises the theoretical analysis of the body of methods and principles associated with a branch of knowledge.<br />
           Typically, it encompasses concepts such as paradigm, theoretical model, phases and quantitative or qualitative techniques.[1] <br />
           A methodology does not set out to provide solutions - it is, therefore, not the same as a method. <br />
           Instead, a methodology offers the theoretical underpinning for understanding which method, set of methods, or so-called “best practices” can be applied to specific case, for example, to calculating a specific result.

            Relationship among methodology, theory, paradigm, algorithm and method[edit] <br />
            The methodology is the general research strategy that outlines the way in which research is to be undertaken and, among other things, identifies the methods to be used in it. <br />
            These methods, described in the methodology, define the means or modes of data collection or, sometimes, how a specific result is to be calculated.[4] <br />
            Methodology does not define specific methods, even though much attention is given to the nature and kinds of processes to be followed in a particular procedure or to attain an objective
